I prefer to use JI for a banwave.
Therefor JI is recomended

JI as banwave
   1. Player gets caught hacking
      1.5. Player is added by staff
   2. Player is added to JI's JDay (Judgement day)
      2.5. Staff are notified
   3. JI Waits for a certain time.
   4. Judgement day occurs
      4.5. One by one it bans all of the players with the configured JDay command.
         4.5.5. Brodcasts {Player} has been banned.
Code:
prefix: '&8&l[&4&lGWEN&8&l] '
ban-timer: '&c%player% &7will be banned in 5 seconds. &cReason &7[&c%check%&7]'
alerts: '&c%player% &7failed &7[&c%check%&7] [&bVL%vl%&7] %tags%'
punish-commands:
- 'ba ban %player% gwen &8&l[&4&lGWEN&8&l]: &c(JI) Unfair Advantage! &7(%check%)'
- 'broadcast &8&l[&4&lGWEN&8&l]&c: (JI) &a%player% &chas been banned for &7(%check%)'
jday-added: '&c%player% &7was added to the jday list. &cReason &7[&c%check%&7]'
jday-command: ban %player% (JDay) %check%
autoban-cancel: '&7You canceled &c%player% &7autoban queue.'
jday-broadcast: '&3%player% &7has been removed permanently from the network.'
NOTE: CODE WILL BE EDITED SOON.

In a perspective of a player.
ji says the wave is in a certain ammount of time.
players warp to court, jail, prison, other and wait for JDay to occur
JDAY occurs
Players are banned 1 by 1
players notic all of the players that will be banned have 4 guardians floating above the suspects head.
   spreading the players so the chunk dosent get too laggy would be smart. use the /spreadnear command i think.
the plyer explodes and the guardian goes away.

WITH MOBSTACKER INSTALLED, THE 4 GUARDIANS DO SPAWN BUT THEY GET COMBINDED TO ONE MOB INSTANTLY.
YOU ONLY SEE ONE GUARDIN INSTEAD OF 4
ALSO THE GUARDIAN DOSENT GO AWAY CAUSE IT IS A NEW DIFFERENT ENTITY.
TRY AND MAKE YOUR LAG CLEARER BYPASS GUARDIANS
