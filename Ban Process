I prefer to use JI for a banwave.

JI as banwave
   1. Player gets caught hacking
      1.5. Player is added by staff
   2. Player is added to JI's JDay (Judgement day)
      2.5. Staff are notified
   3. JI Waits for a certain time.
   4. Judgement day occurs
      4.5. One by one it bans all of the players with the configured JDay command.
         4.5.5. Brodcasts {Player} has been banned.
Code:
prefix: '&8&l[&4&lGWEN&8&l] '
ban-timer: '&c%player% &7will be banned in 5 seconds. &cReason &7[&c%check%&7]'
alerts: '&c%player% &7failed &7[&c%check%&7] [&bVL%vl%&7] %tags%'
punish-commands:
- 'ba ban %player% gwen &8&l[&4&lGWEN&8&l]: &c(JI) Unfair Advantage! &7(%check%)'
- 'broadcast &8&l[&4&lGWEN&8&l]&c: (JI) &a%player% &chas been banned for &7(%check%)'
jday-added: '&c%player% &7was added to the jday list. &cReason &7[&c%check%&7]'
jday-command: ban %player% (JDay) %check%
autoban-cancel: '&7You canceled &c%player% &7autoban queue.'
jday-broadcast: '&3%player% &7has been removed permanently from the network.'
NOTE: CODE WILL BE EDITED SOON.
